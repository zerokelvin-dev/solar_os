# SolarOS Shell Commands

This document covers built-in shell commands. Foreground applications are
documented separately in [apps.md](apps.md). Command availability depends on the
compiled firmware flavor and board capabilities; `commands` shows the commands in
the running image.

## Shell Conventions

Paths are resolved relative to the current shell directory. The default storage
volume is presented as `/`. On SD-backed boards, the primary SD card volume also
has the internal mount path `/sdcard`, and the internal flash volume is mounted
at `/flash`. On boards without SD support, internal flash is mounted as `/`.

Wildcard patterns are supported by selected filesystem commands, for example
`*.txt`.

Tab completion covers commands, subcommands, filesystem paths, job names, port
names, and stream IDs where the command exposes enough structure.
Completed paths that contain spaces are inserted as quoted shell tokens.
For `ssh` and `scp`, it also reads host aliases from `/.ssh/hosts`. An explicit
`user@` prefix is preserved; a unique SCP host match appends `:` for the remote
path.

`Ctrl+V` pastes the shared SolarOS clipboard at the command-line cursor. Line
breaks and tabs become spaces, and a paste stops at the shell input limit; it
never executes a command by itself.

Invalid input is reported as a specific problem followed by only the relevant
usage line. Close, unambiguous command and subcommand typos include a `did you
mean` hint; SolarOS never runs the suggested command automatically. Missing,
unexpected, and invalid arguments identify the affected argument and its
expected form. Passwords, tokens, and other credential values are redacted.

Quotes and backslash escapes are checked before a command runs. Unterminated
quotes, a trailing backslash, too many arguments, and unsupported shell
operators such as `|`, `>`, `&&`, and `;` reject the complete line. URLs and
ordinary argument text containing punctuation remain valid.

Shell scripts use the `.sh` extension. Run one with `sh <file>` or invoke its
path directly; for example, `./somescript.sh` is equivalent to
`sh ./somescript.sh`. SolarOS storage does not require an executable permission
bit for this shorthand. Use `echo` for script progress messages and `wait` to
insert a whole-second delay between commands. `wait` does not put the device
into light sleep. A foreground application
launch ends the current script; the script does not resume after the application
closes.

History is kept in memory and cached at `/.shell/history` when storage is
available. The optional user alias file follows the default storage volume:

```text
/.shell/alias
```

Playground separately maintains `/.shell/playground`. Do not edit that file;
installing, updating, or uninstalling community applications regenerates it.

The startup script source is selected with `setterm startup [auto|flash|sd]`
and is stored in NVS. `auto` is the default, including after `nvs clear`: it
uses a mounted board-owned SD card when available and otherwise falls back to
internal flash. `flash` and `sd` are explicit selections without fallback. On
an SD-capable board, the paths are `/flash/.shell/startup` and
`/sdcard/.shell/startup`; on a board without SD, internal flash is mounted at
`/`, so its path is `/.shell/startup`. The script runs once per boot on the
first startup-enabled shell. Shell sessions created by that script do not run
it again.

The device user and hostname are stored in NVS and configured with `identity`.
The user is also the default remote username used by `ssh` and `scp` when
`user@host` is not supplied.
On the first boot after upgrading, existing `/.solar/user` and
`/.solar/hostname` values are imported when the corresponding NVS value is not
already set.

The display-shell app exit chord is `CTRL+ALT+DEL`. Port shells use `Ctrl+]`.

| `email` | `email sync` | Start a one-shot mailbox synchronization. |
| `email` | `email forget` | Remove the saved account and local email list. |
| `pocsag` | `pocsag status` | Show POCSAG receiver configuration, counters, correction statistics, and RSSI. |
| `pocsag` | `pocsag send <radio> <frequency-hz> <baud> <ric> <message> [alpha\|numeric] [normal\|inverted] [function]` | Encode and transmit one POCSAG page. |

`nvs status` distinguishes raw free entries from entries currently available
for new data; use the available count when diagnosing a failed NVS write.
`nvs list` does not display values, so credentials and other secrets are not
printed. Namespace entry totals include the namespace record itself. Clearing a
namespace removes all of its keys, but ESP-IDF retains its one-entry namespace
record. `nvs erase` reboots after a successful change because running services
can cache NVS-backed settings. Use `nvs backup` before erasing unfamiliar
namespaces or keys.
`nvs backup` writes a versioned, CRC-protected image of the complete default NVS
partition. The file contains unencrypted credentials and settings, so protect
it like a password. `nvs restore` accepts only a complete backup for the current
NVS partition address and size, verifies its CRC before changing flash, verifies
the written partition again, and reboots. `nvs clear` erases the complete
default NVS partition, including identity, Wi-Fi and BLE state, credentials,
service settings, and radio profiles, then reboots. Files on SD or the internal
FAT filesystem are not affected.

Sessions are foreground application state plus shell instances attached to a
display target or byte-stream port. Background services such as log followers,
SLIP, DAQ, and HTTP serving are jobs and are controlled with `job`.

Scripts are intentionally simple. `sh` skips blank lines and lines whose first
non-space character is `#`, then executes each remaining line as a normal shell
command. Diagnostics produced through the common command parser include the
script path and line number. A failed or malformed command does not execute, and
the script continues with its next line; `exit` stops the script and closes its
port shell. There are no variables, pipes, redirects, or conditionals yet.

`man TOPIC` opens one manual entry in the `less` pager when that app is
installed. Use `q`, `Esc`, or the app-exit key to return to the shell. `man -k`
searches page names, aliases, summaries, keywords, and API contracts; `man
--list` shows every entry compiled into the current flavor. Optional topics are
omitted when their package is absent. The same generated registry supplies the
agent's `solaros_reference` tool, so local help and generated-code guidance do
not drift apart.

Bare `help` opens a foldable topic tree. Graphic display shells read the
selected topic in `reader`; text shells use `less`, both through the same
`man:TOPIC` source. On builds with Wi-Fi, PSRAM, and SD, `help update` shows
terminal-width-aware progress while downloading one `manual.zip` published for
the exact running firmware version. The catalog signature authenticates the
archive hash; after extraction every Markdown page is checked by size and
SHA-256 before activation. `help reset` returns immediately to the embedded
manual.

User aliases are stored in `/.shell/alias`, one per line:

```text
name command-or-app fixed-args...
```

Arguments typed after the alias are appended.
SolarOS reads the user file before the managed `/.shell/playground` aliases, so
a user alias with the same name takes precedence. Native commands and firmware
applications always take precedence over both alias files.
Tab completion expands the complete fixed alias target. For example,
`run playground run` completes installed application IDs after `run `.

The inbox is a persistent, producer-neutral message sink. Radio decoders,
background chat or mail jobs, and shell scripts publish messages with a source,
optional topic/sender/title, priority, timestamp, and body. New messages are
unread by default. The status bar shows an envelope and unread count; reading or
clearing messages durably updates that count. The newest 64 messages are kept in
PSRAM when available and mirrored by a fixed-size ring at
`/.inbox/messages.bin`; its compiled maximum is below 32 KB, so systems using
the 64 KB internal flash volume cannot grow the inbox without bound. Replayed
mail and chat notifications retain their existing read state. The browser shows
newest messages first; opening a message marks the shared entry read.

Email configuration is saved in NVS and deliberately has no compiled remote
server or account default. Only `imaps://` endpoints are accepted, with TLS
certificate validation enabled. Use a provider-specific app password where
available. The password is supplied as a shell argument and stored with the
device configuration, so treat shell history and physical access to the device
as sensitive. `email sync` performs one synchronization; use the `email-sync`
job for periodic polling.

### Native ELF modules

`load` is the low-level maintainer interface for the native-module runtime. It
is compiled only for ESP32-S3 boards with PSRAM. The command resolves the ELF
path through the calling shell's current directory, reads at most 2 MiB into
PSRAM, validates every ELF header and table boundary, checks for an Xtensa
ELF32 dynamic object, relocates it into executable PSRAM, and calls its entry
point with the supplied arguments.

Native modules import the single versioned `solar_os_native_host_v1` symbol.
The returned function table reports the ABI version, target, firmware version,
and provides UTF-8 output through the shell that invoked `load`. Arbitrary
SolarOS or ESP-IDF internals are not exported. The first ABI is intentionally
small so later operations can be added after their ownership and lifetime
rules are defined. Native ELF code is not sandboxed; `load` is for trusted,
maintainer-produced modules only.

The `load` runner is for short-lived command-style modules. A module must stop
all of its work and release every callback and resource before its entry point
returns, because the runner immediately unloads its code and data. Installed
jobs and drivers use separate resident lifecycle ABIs instead of this runner.

The standalone `modules/hello` ESP-IDF project builds a small acceptance
module.

Official native-module catalogs are versioned with the host firmware. `pkg`
accepts a catalog only when its ECDSA signature, SolarOS version, ESP target,
and native ABI match the running firmware. Each downloaded ELF must match the
signed size and SHA-256, pass the same ELF validation as `load`, and is staged
before atomic activation. The signed type selects the storage and lifecycle
boundary: application modules use `/modules/apps/<module>.elf`, jobs use
`/modules/jobs`, and drivers use `/modules/drivers`. Every entry separately
declares its lifecycle ABI and its type-specific native host API size.
Application lifecycle ABI 1 is the synchronous `main(argc, argv)`
run-and-unload contract. Job lifecycle ABI 1 registers start, stop, and tick
callbacks and keeps the ELF resident until the stopped job is removed. Driver
lifecycle ABI 1 registers a zero-binding utility driver contract and keeps the
ELF resident until all devices are detached and the module is removed.
Installed jobs and drivers are reactivated during boot. The default repository is
`https://solar-os.eu/ota/modules`.

Run `pkg` without arguments to open the package manager. It refreshes the
signed catalog in a worker, marks installed entries with `*`, and lets you
inspect, install, remove, or refresh modules without blocking screen redraws.
After a successful catalog check, `pkg install` completion uses that verified
catalog. `pkg remove` completion and `pkg installed` read the installed module
directories directly.

Installed application modules are shell commands: the module ID resolves under
`/modules/apps` after built-in commands, compiled applications, and aliases.
Command completion lists installed applications. `load` remains available for
explicit paths and diagnostics. Reinstalling an application from the schema-v1
layout moves it into `/modules/apps`; `pkg remove` also recognizes the legacy
flat application path during this transition.

The acceptance modules exercise all three paths. Use `pkg install hello-job`,
then `job start hello-job`, `job status hello-job`, and `job stop hello-job`.
Use `pkg install hello-driver`, then `expansion attach hello-driver hello0` and
`expansion detach hello0`. The hello driver claims no GPIO or bus. `pkg remove`
rejects a running job or a driver with an attached device.

For example:

```text
pkg available
pkg installed
pkg install hello
hello SolarOS
pkg remove hello
```

### Power, RTC, schedules, and terminal settings

`power` usage:

```text
power status
power profile [performance|balanced|battery|lowpower]
power idle [off|seconds]
power key [off|sleep|suspend]
power sleep
power suspend
```

Profiles:

| Profile | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `performance` | CPU fixed at 240 MHz, no automatic light sleep. This is the default. |
| `balanced` | CPU fixed at 160 MHz, no automatic light sleep. |
| `battery` | CPU fixed at 160 MHz with ESP-IDF automatic light sleep. |
| `lowpower` | CPU fixed at 80 MHz with automatic light sleep and display-shell idle sleep after 60 seconds. |

Suspend is different from explicit light sleep. It keeps the runtime, radios,
background jobs, Inbox notifications, and audio active while the primary
display is off. It temporarily uses the `lowpower` profile and prevents the
idle policy from entering explicit light sleep. Another short press of KEY
resumes the display and restores the selected profile. `power status` shows
the selected profile, effective profile, and suspend state.

`power key` retains `off` for compatibility. `sleep` uses the existing light
sleep path, and `suspend` toggles the runtime suspend state. The default for a
new or cleared NVS configuration is `suspend`; an existing saved value remains
unchanged.

`rtc` is the low-level hardware interface. `rtc status` remains useful on
boards without RTC hardware and reports `unavailable` there.

```text
rtc status
rtc alarm set HH:MM[:SS] [day=N] [weekday=N]
rtc alarm clear
rtc timer set <duration> [repeat]
rtc timer clear
rtc pending
rtc ack <alarm|timer|all>
```

Direct alarm and timer controls are leased. If the scheduler or a script owns
the requested hardware slot, the command reports the owner instead of replacing
its wake-up configuration.

`schedule` stores named alarms and script jobs in the internal flash filesystem
at `.solar/schedule.bin`. Updates replace the file atomically. Durations accept
`s`, `m`, `h`, or `d`; dates and times use configured local time.

```text
schedule list
schedule show <name>

Only one scheduled shell script runs at a time. A due script is skipped and its
skip counter increases if another scheduled script is still running. Scheduled
scripts run without a terminal, and attempts to launch foreground applications
are rejected. Calendar schedules wait for valid wall-clock time. Interval
schedules continue to work from monotonic uptime without an RTC.

During explicit light sleep, the nearest schedule is armed as an internal timer.
When a wired interrupt-capable RTC is available, the scheduler also programs its
calendar alarm when wall-clock time is valid and, for a monotonic schedule, its
countdown timer. The RTC GPIO is added to the wake sources. This lets countdowns
use the RTC even while wall-clock time is invalid. An RTC interrupt can wake
light sleep; it cannot turn on a board whose hardware power has been switched
off.

`setterm` usage:

```text
setterm
setterm --display <target> [orientation|font|textsize|palette|statusbar] [value]
setterm orientation [0|90|180|270]
setterm font [mono|compact]
setterm textsize [10|12|14|16|18|20]
setterm palette [normal|inverted]
setterm foreground [#RRGGBB]
setterm background [#RRGGBB]
setterm statusbar [show|hide]
setterm brightness [0..100]
setterm backlight [0..100]
setterm profile [vt100|ansi|dumb]
setterm charset [utf8|ascii]
setterm keyboard [us|de]
setterm powerkey [sleep|suspend]
setterm keyrate [off|1..60 [delay-ms]]
setterm ble [default|on|off]
setterm timezone [UTC|UTC+/-offset|Europe/Berlin|POSIX-TZ]
setterm startup [auto|flash|sd]
setterm otaurl [url]
```

`setterm keyrate` configures the shared repeat policy for BLE, PS/2, CardKB,
and the CL-32 keyboard, fixed board buttons, `gpio-keys`, and ADC D-pads.
Analog joysticks publish axes and do not generate key events.
The value is stored in NVS and is available on builds without BLE.

`setterm ble` selects the next-boot BLE preference. `default` clears the saved
override and follows the active board profile; `on` and `off` remain in effect
across firmware updates until changed. The current boot is unchanged.

`setterm timezone` accepts fixed offsets with the conventional UTC sign:
`UTC-8` is eight hours behind UTC and `UTC+5:30` is five hours and 30 minutes
ahead. Fixed offsets do not apply daylight-saving transitions. Other accepted
timezone expressions use POSIX TZ syntax and its POSIX sign convention.
SolarOS does not include the IANA timezone database; `Europe/Berlin` is a
built-in daylight-saving alias.

`setterm powerkey` selects the dedicated KEY short-press action. `sleep`
enters explicit light sleep; `suspend` turns off the display while jobs and
services continue. `setterm key` is accepted as a shorter alias.

`setterm startup` selects the volume used for `.shell/startup` on the next boot.
The default `auto` setting prefers a mounted board-owned SD card and falls back
to flash when SD is unavailable. `flash` always selects internal flash, even
when an SD card is mounted. `sd` always selects SD and is rejected on boards
without SD support. Use `setterm startup` without a value to show the selected
source and currently resolved path.

`setterm profile` and `setterm charset` are runtime-only and apply to the
current port shell. From the display shell they print guidance to configure
them from a port shell. `profile` controls terminal escape sequences;
`charset` controls TUI glyph output. The default `utf8` mode uses Unicode box
drawing. Select `ascii` for DOS and other legacy serial terminals; TUI borders,
blocks, arrows, and punctuation are replaced with readable ASCII characters.
Display layout settings (`orientation`, `font`, `textsize`, `palette`, and
`statusbar`) apply
to the current display and its app sessions. Settings on the primary display
are persistent; settings on secondary or virtual displays such as `web0` are
runtime-only. When no saved values exist, the font defaults to `compact` and
the text size defaults to `16`. `palette` exchanges logical black and white in
terminal content
and in the shared graphics palette; dithered shades are reversed as well. It
remains independent of hardware inversion modes exposed by `display mode`, and
does not rewrite an existing framebuffer. On a headless board, a port shell can
set or query the persistent palette before an expansion-display session exists;
subsequently created terminal and graphic sessions inherit it.

`setterm --display <target>` reads or changes the volatile terminal profile of
a named runtime display target, even when a TUI application rather than a shell
owns that display. The target profile is initialized from the single global NVS
parameter set when the display registers. Orientation is relative to the
target's native panel rotation, so `0` keeps every display in its normal
mounting even when their drivers use different U8g2 rotations. Display-targeted
absolute pointer coordinates follow this logical orientation. A targeted change
applies to current and future sessions on that display until reboot or until the
display target is unregistered; it does not create or update per-display NVS
keys. Without a setting, the command prints the target's complete volatile
profile. For example:

```text
setterm --display oled0 statusbar hide
setterm --display oled0 textsize 10
setterm --display oled0 palette inverted
```

`foreground` and `background` select the persistent RGB theme colors for the
built-in color display. They color terminal scanout and semantic GUI elements,
including text, backgrounds, borders, and intermediate shades. Explicit RGB
image, canvas, and script colors remain literal. Use six hexadecimal digits,
for example `setterm foreground '#d8e8ff'` and `setterm background '#102030'`;
the leading `#` can be omitted. The defaults are `#000000` and `#ffffff`.
These settings do not add a color framebuffer or affect monochrome-display
rendering. `palette inverted` continues to exchange the foreground and
background roles.

`setterm statusbar hide` removes the top status bar from graphical shell
sessions and gives its space to the terminal. `show` restores it. The default is
`show` when no value is stored in NVS.

On BLE-capable builds, the status bar has a separate Bluetooth symbol: plain
means enabled for the current boot, slashed means disabled, and a small search
marker means scanning. The keyboard symbol shows only availability: plain when
at least one keyboard is available, slashed otherwise, regardless of transport.
Compact displays omit icons that do not fit before the clock and unread count.

## Apps And Jobs

| Command | Usage | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps` | `apps` | List registered foreground apps compiled into the firmware. |
| `agent` | `agent`; `agent new`; `agent ask PROMPT...` | Open a new native LLM agent TUI or make one unsaved foreground request. |
| `agent` | `agent list`; `agent resume SLOT`; `agent delete SLOT` | List, restore, or delete durable local conversation slots. |
| `agent` | `agent status`; `agent tools` | Inspect provider state, request statistics, typed tools, risk, and policy. |
| `agent` | `agent config endpoint|model|key|reasoning|tools|max-tools VALUE` | Configure the provider and tool policy. |
| `agent` | `agent script python\|lua (-c SOURCE \| FILE) [ARGS...]` | Run a bounded script through the agent execution path. |
| `agent` | `agent forget` | Erase the saved agent configuration. |
| `jobs` | `jobs` | List registered jobs and their state. |
| `job` | `job status [name]` | Show one job or all jobs. |
| `job` | `job start <name> [args...]` | Start or restart a job. |
| `job` | `job stop <name>` | Stop a job. |
| `session` | `session list` | List display sessions, port shells, and retained port-owned application sessions with their owner. |
| `session` | `session create shell <port> [--term auto|vt100|ansi|dumb] [--charset utf8|ascii] [--size COLSxROWS]` | Start a shell session on a byte-stream port. |
| `session` | `session create shell <display-target>` | Attach a shell session to a ready display target such as `lcd0`. |
| `session` | `session create <app> <display-target> [args...]` | Start a foreground application as the active session on a named display. |
| `session` | `session focus [display-target]` | Show or assign the display that receives BLE keyboard and local board-control input. |
| `session` | `session fg [id]` or `session switch [id]` | Resume a display session or a port-owned app on its owning terminal. Without an ID, restore the calling port's last suspended app. |
| `session` | `session close <id>` | Close a display app, display shell, port-owned app, or port shell session. |
| `session` | `session send <id> <command> [args...]` | Run a command on an active display-shell session. The target must be at an empty prompt. |
| `session` | `session background` | Explain the foreground/background controls. |

Port shells default to `--term auto`. Auto mode sends a terminal Device
Attributes probe; a recognizable response enables VT100-style cursor controls
and a size probe, while no response falls back to a dumb line-oriented shell.
The dumb profile can run line-oriented shell commands, but cursor-addressable
TUI applications cannot run on it and report
`<app>: can't run on a dumb terminal`.
Use `--term vt100` or `--term ansi` to force escape-sequence output,
`--term dumb` for plain text, and `--size COLSxROWS` to set the terminal
dimensions without probing. Character encoding is independent of that profile:
port shells default to `--charset utf8`; use `--charset ascii` when a legacy
terminal displays Unicode TUI glyphs as unrelated code-page characters.

`jobs` prints a compact table that fits the built-in display terminal:

```text
NAME         STATE    STACK KIND        EVT  TICKS RES
batmon       running      - background  tick    17   1
log          stopped   6144 background  tick     0   0
```

Columns:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `NAME` | Job registry name. |
| `STATE` | `stopped`, `waiting`, `running`, or `failed`. A waiting launch retries automatically. |
| `STACK` | Declared worker-stack admission requirement in bytes; `-` means no dedicated stack is declared. Dynamic allocations are not included. |
| `KIND` | Job kind. Current registry jobs are background workers. |
| `EVT` | `tick` if the job receives periodic tick events, otherwise `-`. |
| `TICKS` | Number of dispatched tick events while running. |
| `RES` | Number of resources currently recorded for the job. |

Use `job status <name>` for the job summary, owner string, last error, effective
worker-stack placement, tick interval/deadline, last and maximum handler time,
deadline-miss count, and resource details. Running rows are bold. A `waiting`
job has retained its launch request until the stack can be admitted while
preserving the internal-memory reserve; a `failed` job completed a start attempt
with an error. `sessions` prints the same timing telemetry for display and
port sessions as one row per session in `ID TITLE APP STATE TIME` order. In the
`TIME` column, the first pair is `interval/deadline` in milliseconds, the second
is `last/max` in microseconds, `n` is the dispatch count, and `!` is the deadline
miss count. Job timing detail uses the same values with explicit labels.
Job-owned resources use owner strings such as `job:log`; port
conflicts are reported as readable messages such as `job log owns cdc0`.

Common job examples:

```text
session create shell cdc0
session create shell uart0 --term ansi --charset ascii --size 80x25
session create shell lcd0
session create files display0
session focus display0
job start log cdc0
job start log file /.shell/log info
job start bridge cdc0 uart0
job start bridge uart0 link0 broadcast
link stream create link0 vser0 0x12345678
job start bridge cdc0 vser0
job start gpio-keys gpio17:UP gpio2:ENTER
job start gpio-keys --config /flash/gpio-keys.conf
job start graffiti
job start gesture-listener
job start httpd /www
job start displayd [display-target]   # display0 by default, web0 when headless
job start ntp-sync once
job start batmon 60
job start slip uart0 115200
job start pppd uart0 baud=115200
job stop log
```

Only one instance of each built-in job name is active at a time. Starting the
same job again stops the previous instance and starts it with the new arguments.

disk mount sd0p2 /mnt
ramfs mount /tmp 1m
ramfs mount / 4m
ramfs unmount /tmp
zip /books/archive.zip /books/*.txt
unzip -l /books/archive.zip
```

## Streams, Logs, Ports, And Transfers

| Command | Usage | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stream` | `stream` or `stream list` | List dynamic typed stream endpoints. |
| `stream` | `stream status <id>` | Show type, direction, provider, format, owner, and counters for one stream. |
| `daq` | `daq help` | Print DAQ usage. |
| `daq` | `daq status` | Show DAQ job status. |
| `daq` | `daq streams` | List stream IDs. |
| `daq` | `daq start <file.csv> <stream...> [--rate seconds\|--rate-ms ms]`; `daq start <stream...> <file.csv> [--rate seconds\|--rate-ms ms]` | Start periodic CSV capture from one or more streams. |
| `daq` | `daq start <file.csv> <stream> --changes [--append\|--replace]` | Capture a scalar or event stream only when its value changes. |
| `daq` | `daq start <file.bin> <byte-or-audio-stream> --raw [--rate-ms ms]` | Capture one byte or PCM audio stream without CSV framing. |

| `port` | `port list` | List byte-stream ports. |
| `port` | `port status <name>` | Show port capabilities and owner. |
| `xfer` | `xfer protocols` | List supported and reserved transfer protocols. |
| `xfer` | `xfer send <port> <file> --raw [-d ms]` | Send a file as raw bytes, optionally delaying between chunks. |
| `xfer` | `xfer recv <port> <file> --raw [--append\|--replace] [--idle-ms ms]` | Receive raw bytes until the idle timeout and append or replace the destination. |
| `xfer` | `xfer send <port> <file> --zmodem` | Send a file with ZMODEM. |
| `xfer` | `xfer recv <port> <file> --zmodem [--append\|--replace]` | Receive a file with ZMODEM and append or replace the destination. |

DAQ usage:

```text
daq start <file.csv> <stream...> [--rate seconds|--rate-ms ms]
daq start <stream...> <file.csv> [--rate seconds|--rate-ms ms]
daq start <file.csv> <stream> --changes [--append|--replace]
daq start <file.bin> <byte-or-audio-stream> --raw [--rate-ms ms]
daq stop
```

DAQ examples:

```text
daq start /logs/env.csv temperature humidity battery --rate 60
daq start /logs/key.csv gpio17 --changes
daq start /logs/uart0.bin uart0 --raw --rate-ms 25
daq start /logs/microphones.pcm audio0.capture --raw
```

`daq` CSV rows include `uptime_ms`, and include UTC `time_ms` when wall-clock time is
trusted. Raw mode accepts one byte or audio source and writes its data directly
without CSV framing. Audio uses the native PCM format reported by `stream
status`; `arecord` writes the same input as a WAV file. `recorder` adds
interactive stream and WAV-format selection, no-file live input monitoring,
hardware input gain when the selected device supports it, visualization,
pause, and playback.

Streams are runtime-registered endpoints, similar to services and displays.
Providers can add or remove scalar sensor, event, byte, and PCM audio streams.
Direction is `source`, `sink`, or `duplex`; sharing and current ownership are
reported by `stream status`. Board audio devices currently publish
`audio0.capture` and/or `audio0.playback`. Microphone level compatibility
streams remain available as `mic0` and `mic1` where the board has two input
channels.

Transfer usage:

```text
xfer protocols
xfer send <port> <file> --raw [-d ms]
xfer recv <port> <file> --raw [--append|--replace] [--idle-ms ms]
xfer send <port> <file> --zmodem
xfer recv <port> <file> --zmodem [--append|--replace]
```

`raw` and `zmodem` are supported. `kermit` is reserved but not implemented.

## Networking

| `wireguard` | `wireguard import <file>` | Validate one standard WireGuard client profile and save it in NVS. The source file is not removed. |
| `wireguard` | `wireguard forget` | Logically remove the saved profile from NVS. Bring the tunnel down first. |
| `wireguard` | `wireguard up [fail-open\|fail-closed]` | Request the tunnel and reconnect it when the preferred network underlay changes. The default is fail-closed for a full tunnel and fail-open for a split tunnel. |
| `wireguard` | `wireguard down` | Stop the tunnel, remove its routes, restore DNS, and disable its kill switch. |
| `ble` | `ble [status]` | Show BLE keyboard state and the current/next boot setting. |

| `ping` | `ping <host> [count]` | Send ICMP echo requests. Without count, ping runs until Esc, Ctrl+C, or app-exit. |
| `netscan` | `netscan <host|range> [ports]` | Scan TCP ports on one host or a capped IPv4 range. |
| `ntp` | `ntp [server]` | Sync the wall clock from NTP. |

Wi-Fi is enabled by default when no saved setting exists, including after `nvs
clear`. `wifi on` and `wifi off` control the radio in the current boot. The
`wifi enable` and `wifi disable` settings take effect only after a reboot.
Disabling Wi-Fi does not erase saved station, access-point, or NAT settings.

WireGuard accepts one IPv4 interface address, one peer, one optional numeric
IPv4 DNS server, and at most eight IPv4 `AllowedIPs` prefixes. IPv6 addresses,
multiple peers, interface hooks, and configuration keys outside the documented
client subset are rejected. Use `wireguard down` before importing a replacement
profile or using `wireguard forget`. See [WireGuard VPN client](network.md#wireguard)
for routing, secret, and disconnect behavior.

When no saved preference exists, including after `nvs clear`, BLE follows the
board default. Most boards enable it; TTGO VGA32 v1.4 disables it to preserve
internal heap. `setterm ble on|off|default` stores or clears the preference for
the next boot. `ble enable`, `ble disable`, and `ble default` are equivalent
compatibility commands. Disabling BLE does not forget the remembered keyboard
or erase its BLE bond. On a BLE-disabled boot, SolarOS returns the unused
Bluetooth controller and host memory to the internal heap before normal service
initialization.

When a keyboard exposes the standard Battery Service, SolarOS subscribes to its
Battery Level notifications and reads the initial level when supported. `ble
status`, the general `status` command, and the Python/Lua BLE status strings
include the latest percentage while that keyboard remains connected.

### BLE inspector TUI

Run `ble` without arguments to open the BLE Inspector TUI. Its Devices,
Services, Chars, and Settings tabs support scanning, connecting, service and
characteristic inspection, characteristic reads and hexadecimal writes, and
BLE keyboard settings. Press Tab to move between tabs. The inspector owns its
GATT connection and disconnects it when the TUI closes. Existing `ble status`,
`ble scan`, and `ble gatt ...` commands remain available for scripts and plain
text use. On a BLE-disabled boot, the Settings tab remains available so BLE can
be enabled for the next boot.

### BLE keepalive and GATT

`ble keepalive on` sends the standard HID Exit Suspend command every 30 seconds
when the connected keyboard exposes a writable HID Control Point. It falls back
to reading the HID Information characteristic when Exit Suspend is unavailable.
The setting persists and is off by default. `ble keepalive` reports the selected
method, the last local operation result, and the attempt count. These operations
do not count as SolarOS user activity. They can prevent sleep when a keyboard
bases its inactivity timer on host HID or GATT traffic, but the keyboard remains
in control of its own power policy, so the result is device-specific. `ble
keepalive off` stops the operations.

BLE GATT usage:

```text
ble gatt status
ble gatt connect <aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff> <public|random|rpa_public|rpa_random>
ble gatt disconnect
ble gatt services
ble gatt chars <service-index>
ble gatt read <handle>
ble gatt write <handle> <hex...>
ble gatt write-nr <handle> <hex...>
```

The shell GATT session owns one peer and shares the configured connection budget
with app BLE sessions, which may own multiple peers. It cannot read or disconnect
an app-owned connection. Disconnect and
operation timeout retire the connection asynchronously; reconnect can report
busy until cleanup finishes. A write without response waits for local stack
completion, not a remote acknowledgement. Generic scans are unavailable while
any generic peer is active or retiring.

MQTT usage:

```text
mqtt status
mqtt connect [url [username [password]]]
mqtt disconnect
mqtt publish <topic> <payload> [qos] [retain]
mqtt subscribe <topic> [qos]
```

`mqtt connect mqtt://host[:port] [username [password]]` and
`mqtt connect mqtts://host[:port] [username [password]]` save broker settings
in NVS. Later `mqtt connect` reuses the saved settings.

`netscan` accepts a host, same-subnet range, or compact range form. Examples:

```text
netscan 192.168.1.10 22,80,443
netscan 192.168.1.1-50 22
netscan wintermute 22
```

## OTA And Keys

| Command | Usage | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ota` | `ota status` | Show running and configured OTA state. |
| `ota` | `ota check` | Check signed board/flavor release metadata. |

OTA resolves the artifact for the compiled board and target flavor from the
configured release index, verifies the signed index, verifies firmware SHA-256,
and writes the inactive ESP-IDF OTA partition. A signed `ota check` also caches
the flavors present for the compiled board in RAM. `ota flavor` completion uses
that verified list. Before a check, completion asks you to run `ota check`;
changing the OTA URL or rebooting clears the list. If the selected flavor is
not present in the checked release, `ota check` lists the flavors that are
available for the compiled board.

Board-specific connector resources, runtime GPIO policy, named buses, leases,
and attachment examples are documented in [Expansion Ports](expansion.md).
Use `expansion status` and `gpio list` for the authoritative view on a running
device.

The `onewire` command accepts a registered bus name or any runtime-accessible
GPIO. `onewire status` discovers named buses, while the numeric form preserves
the direct-pin workflow. Every `xfer` starts with a 1-Wire reset, writes the
supplied bytes, and then reads `read-len` bytes. For example,
`onewire xfer 1 9 0xcc 0xbe` issues Skip ROM and Read Scratchpad, then reads a
nine-byte scratchpad. The equivalent named form starts with
`onewire xfer onewire0`. ROM address bytes supplied to `xfer` use
least-significant-byte-first wire order. The service enables the ESP32 internal
pull-up, but a 4.7 kohm external pull-up from the data line to 3.3 V is strongly
recommended. The internal pull-up is not a parasite-power supply.

Physical displays are listed by `display list`. A built-in board panel registers
as a board display target such as `display0`; an expansion display driver stays
in `expansion drivers` as attachable hardware and registers a display target
after it is attached. The built-in board panel is not an expansion driver.
`display list` includes the current owner when a target is claimed. `display
test <target>` claims the target while it draws a visible frame/test pattern,
then releases it. `display mode <target>` lists driver-specific display
settings for supported display drivers; `display mode <target> <mode>` applies
one setting.

`display join wall0 --horizontal display0 lcd0` claims two to four backing
targets and registers `wall0` as one logical target. Horizontal joins place
targets from left to right; vertical joins place them from top to bottom. The
largest cross-axis dimension defines the logical canvas and unused backing
area is cleared. `display split display0 --horizontal left0 right0` claims one
backing target and registers two equal logical viewports. On a 792x272
CrowPanel this creates two 396x272 targets. Each viewport has its own display
buffer, terminal profile, session ownership, and frame-export surface; updating
one viewport preserves the other.

Layouts are runtime-only and are shown by `display layouts`. Backing targets
remain visible in `display list` with an owner such as
`display-layout:display0`, while logical targets have source `layout` and role
`joined` or `viewport`. Layout targets work with normal commands such as
`session create shell left0` and `session create files right0`. A layout cannot
use another layout as backing, does not scale content, and cannot be removed
while any logical target is owned or exported. When the built-in display shell
creates a split, session 0 automatically moves to the first viewport; when it
creates a join containing its current display, it moves to the joined target.
Removing that layout moves session 0 back to its original board display. Shell
state and scrollback are preserved while terminal geometry is recalculated for
the new target. Layout updates are coalesced and backing targets are refreshed
sequentially, which is especially important for e-paper panels. `display
unjoin wall0` and `display unsplit display0` release the backing targets.

With `power=auto`, the built-in ST7305 path uses the normal power
profile before writing changed frame content and switches to the paired `lpm`
profile after the frame has been idle for the configured driver debounce, or
immediately when a present pass finds no changed pixels. The default ST7305
idle debounce is 1000 ms. The advanced
`display mode <target> idle-lpm-ms=<ms>` driver option updates it at runtime
and persists it in the ST7305 NVS namespace. ST7305 tuning options also live on
this driver-specific mode surface: `power=<auto|hpm|lpm>` selects automatic
idle switching or a forced power mode, `inverted=<on|off>` selects panel
inversion, `lpm-hz=<0.25|0.5|1|2|4|8>` changes the controller's LPM frame-rate
field, and `hpm-hz=<16|25.5|32|51>` changes the controller's HPM frame-rate
field. These driver values are stored in NVS when changed. The ST7305
`inverted=` setting controls panel polarity and remains independent of the
terminal palette selected with `setterm palette`.
On SSD1683 board and expansion targets, `refresh=auto` starts with a full
waveform and skips unchanged frames. Waveshare V2 expansion targets use the
changed framebuffer rectangle and the controller's partial-window waveform,
with a full cleanup after every 19 partial updates. The Elecrow 5.79-inch dual
controller transfers both RAM halves with its `0xDC` partial waveform after the
initial cleanup and does not schedule periodic full refreshes. `refresh=fast`
forces a fast full-frame waveform and `refresh=full` forces the full cleanup
waveform on every changed frame.

Packet radio devices are datagram endpoints registered by expansion drivers, not
byte-stream ports. The common radio layer preserves packet metadata such as RSSI
and optional source/destination IDs. Radio frequency values are Hz by default
and also accept `k`, `kHz`, `M`, and `MHz` suffixes:

```text
radio status radio0
radio config radio0 frequency 433MHz
radio config radio0 modulation gfsk
radio send radio0 hello
radio recv radio0 5000
```

Profiles avoid partially reconfiguring one end while copying a list of fields.
`lora-eu868`, `gfsk-eu868`, and `ook-eu868` are built in. Up to eight user
profiles are stored as one versioned NVS record and consume no idle profile
cache:

```text
radio profile list
radio profile apply radio0 lora-eu868
radio config radio0 sf 9
radio profile save radio0 lora-sf9
radio profile show lora-sf9
radio profile remove lora-sf9
```

Like `radio config`, applying a profile leaves the radio in driver standby. If
the driver rejects a setting, SolarOS attempts to restore the complete prior
configuration and operating state. A profile does not bypass the driver's
supported frequency, modulation, power, or packet-size checks. The operator
remains responsible for regional frequency, transmit-power, and duty-cycle
rules.

RFM95W radios support FSK, GFSK, MSK, GMSK, OOK, and LoRa. LoRa additionally
uses `bandwidth`, `sf`, and `coding-rate`. For an RFM95W using the common
868 MHz profile:

```text
radio config radio0 frequency 868MHz
radio config radio0 bandwidth 125000
radio config radio0 sf 7
radio config radio0 coding-rate 4/5
```

`variable=on` selects the normal explicit LoRa header. `variable=off` selects
implicit-header mode and requires the configured `length` to match on both
ends. SF6 requires implicit-header mode.

FSK-family and OOK modes use `bitrate`, `deviation`, and a single-side
`bandwidth`. MSK and GMSK derive deviation as one quarter of bitrate; GFSK and
GMSK use Gaussian BT=1.0 shaping. RFM95W FSK/OOK packets contain at most 64
payload bytes, while fixed length zero enables the unlimited FIFO-stream mode.

The POCSAG job configures an attached packet radio for one paging channel,
filters addresses to one RIC, corrects up to two bad bits per BCH codeword, and
publishes decoded pages to the universal inbox. Consecutive POCSAG batches are
kept in one message. For the 448.425 MHz test channel:

```text
job start pocsag radio 448425000 1200 1841525 alpha
pocsag status
inbox list unread
```

Use `inverted` as the final argument if the transmitter and receiver use
opposite FSK mark/space polarity. Stopping the job restores the radio's previous
configuration and state.

To transmit a page, stop the receiver when it uses the same half-duplex radio,
then send the message. Alphanumeric pages default to function 3; numeric pages
default to function 0. The optional final argument selects function 0 through 3.
The previous radio configuration and state are restored after transmission.

```text
job stop pocsag
pocsag send radio 448425000 1200 1841525 "SolarOS calling" alpha inverted
```
